>Wow, it seems so easy now that you've shown me how!
To thank you, I'd like to share some other tips with you.
Have you taken a look at the Orientation Challenge?
This challenge is limited to past SANS Holiday Hack Challenges from 2015, 2016, and 2017. You DO NOT need to play those challenges.
If you listen closely to Ed Skoudis' talk at the con, you might even pick up all the answers you need...
It may take a little poking around, but with your skills, I'm sure it'll be a wintergreen breeze!
